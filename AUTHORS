Authors of libpion:
===================

Michael Dickey <mike at atomiclabs dot com>


Parts of libpion were derived from or inspired by the HTTP Server example
in the asio documentation.  Many thanks to Christopher M. Kohlhoff and all
the contributors of Boost and asio, without which libpion would not have
been possible.
