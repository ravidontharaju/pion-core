The folder dojo-release contains a Dojo custom build of the Pion UI, which contains
all the Pion UI code, plus all the Dojo source code that it needs, baked into two
main files (dojo/dojo.js and dojo/pion-dojo.js) and an almost minimal set of 
supporting files.  The advantage of this is that startup is much faster because 
only a handful of files need to be loaded.  However, if you want to edit or debug
the Pion UI source code (in ui/scripts, ui/plugins and ui/resources), you will need 
your own copy of Dojo: download 
http://download.dojotoolkit.org/current-dev/dojo-release-1.1.0-src.zip
and extract it into C:, or get it from Subversion:
svn co http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/tags/release-1.1.0/ C:\dojo-release-1.1.0-src
(For non-Windows systems, install it anywhere, and see notes below.)

Uncomment the block in services.xml defining dojo-src-service, and if Dojo was 
installed elsewhere than C:\dojo-release-1.1.0-src, change the "directory" Option 
to the actual directory.  Follow the directions in index.html about how to use
the source code instead of the built code.

If you make changes and want to do a new Dojo custom build, see 
dojo-custom-build/README.  (Not yet implemented for non-Windows systems.)
